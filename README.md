Basic Calculator:

Scope: This project is aimed to developed a fuctional Calculator that can perform arithemetic operations, such as Addition, Substraction, Multiplication and Division. 

User Interface:
(i) user-friendly interface that includes a display for input and results.
(ii) Buttons included for digits (0-9), decimal point, operators(+,-,*,/) and special buttons "Clear" and "Equals".

Functionality:
(i) The core calculation functionality is developed using JavaScript, the layout is sectioned using HTML and the appearance is rendered using CSS.
(ii) This makes core functionality of entering the numerical values, performing calculations and seeing the results on the display user friendly.

Operations:
(i) The Calculator performs the basic arithematic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
(ii) The Calculator follows the correct order of operations (eg., BODMAS/BIDMAS).

Input Handling:
(i) Handles user input accurately and ensures that the calculator responds to button clicks and keyboard input.

Error Handling:
(i) Mathematical errors like dividing by Zero are handled.

✅ BODMAS/BIDMAS (correct operator precedence)
✅ Keyboard and button input
✅ Square root (√) and percentage (%)
✅ Memory functions — M+, M-, MR, MC (store, subtract, recall, clear memory)
✅ Modern, user-friendly interface
